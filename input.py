# we program to solve real life problems
#which means the programs are meant for users
# Which means the programs created are usually meant for the users and not the developers

#This means that the users need to input their data so that they can helped 

#This is where input comes in

#e.g

##input("What is your Name: ") # The input function will help the user enter his/her name Though there is nothing right now he can  do to proceed
##input("What is your Age")
##input("What is your Gender")
##input("What is your age?")
##input("What is your score")
##input("What is your height")
##input("What is your weight")
##input("What is your skin color")
##input("What is your favorite food")
##input("What is your favorite sport")

#though the above help in the user inputting data, it is not stored meaning whatever answered is useless
#unless we use variables to store data
#e.g

Name = input("What is your Name?") # instead of already assigning a variable to an already available string, we let the user input his own name, storing the data in the variable called Name
# meaning everytime we print Name, the name of the user is what is going to be printed.
Age = input("What is your Age")
Gender = input("What is your Gender")
age = input("What is your age?")
score = input("What is your score")
height = input("What is your height")
weight=input("What is your weight")
color = input("What is your skin color")
food = input("What is your favorite food")
sport = input("What is your favorite sport")

#remember input always accepts the data as string, meaning that age and score will be in the form of string not integers/floats

print(Name)
print(Gender)
print(age)
print(Age)
print(score)
print(height)
