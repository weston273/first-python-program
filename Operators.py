#You can do mathematical Operations in python using +,/,-,*,% to name a few

#first creating variables to use for operations

x = 15 
y = 30
#addition
print(x)
print(y)
print("add",x + y) #output is 45
print(f"addition {x + y}") # output is 45
print(x+y)
#subtraction
print(x-y) #-15
print(y-x) #15
# float division
print(x/y) #o.5 Outputs a float
print(y/x) #2.0 outputs a float too
#Integer division
print(x//y) #0 still remains an integer
print(y//x) #2
#multiplication
print(x*y) #prints 450
#modulus
print(x%y) # divides x and 15 but only prints the remainder
print(x**y) # x to the powerof y, x=> base : y=> power
#conditional operators, greater than,smaller than etc
print(x<y) # True prints Boolean (True/False)
print(x>y) # False

#you can also use variables in the use of operators

add = x+y
sub = x-y
mult = x*y
F_div = x/y
I_div = x//y
power_of = x ** y 

# creating variables help to print the value as you have already done the math already

#e.g
print(add) # same answer since add holds the value x+y
print(sub)
print(mult)
print(F_div)
print(I_div)
print(power_of)
