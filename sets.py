# Sets => creation of unique elements, mutable, you can ADD/ REMOVE DATA, 
#when we create stets in Python we use curly brackets,{}

#e.g creation of set pupils:

pupils = {"Matthew","John","Mary","Samantha"} #everytime we add data it is seperated by a comma
numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,}
floatse = {0.1,0.2,0.3}

#Intersection (&)

#Intersecting of sets means only taking what is common amongst the intersecting sets, for example both set A and B have 1,3,5,7 as the common values

# as we mentioned on line 1 , sets are mutable meaning we can ADD/ REMOVE data

#1. Adding

A.add(12)
B.add(13)
C.add(14)
D.add(15)
E.add(11)
F.add(10)
G.add(100)
H.add(99)
I.add(10001)
J.add(16)
H.add(7)

# you can also add many elements to a set using one method,
# it is called the update method

#2. Updating a set

A.update([13,14,15,16])
B.update([89,99,100])
C.update([12,24,54])
D.update([3456,5,56])
E.update([23,45,6])
F.update([6735,78])
G.update([56,67,3])
H.update([354,78,56])
I.update([78,45,2])
J.update([9,45,7,8])

# Since we can add values, we can also remove them

# there are two ways of removing elements in a set
#1. the. remove method => which causes an error if we are to look for a specific value
#2. the .discard method => which prevents errors from occuring even if we where to look for the value removed

##A.remove(2)
##B.remove(13)
##C.remove(14)
##D.remove(1) # outputs error cox there is no 1 in set D
##E.remove(11)
##F.remove(10)
##G.remove(100)
##H.remove(99)
##I.remove(16)
##J.remove(12)
##H.remove(6)

# to prevent that error we use the second method

#2. the .discard method

A.discard(2)
B.discard(13)
C.discard(14)
D.discard(1) 
E.discard(11)
F.discard(10)
G.discard(100)
H.discard(99)
I.discard(16)
J.discard(12)
H.discard(6)
